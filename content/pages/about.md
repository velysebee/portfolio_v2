      I'm Vanessa! I'm an animator, storyboarder, and producer based in Houston,
      Texas (and looking onward to Los Angeles!)


      I graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2024 with a BFA in
      Film/Animation/Video. In my junior thesis projects and thesis film,
      "[Chasing Butterflies](/chasing-butterflies)" I explored narrative
      storytelling without dialogue and blending techniques and aesthetics of
      traditional media in my digital animation. I worked as a production lead
      on my projects as well as on a collaborative animated film, "[Curse
      Reverse](/curse-reverse)".


      Outside of animation, I also enjoy illustration, knitting & crocheting,
      and ballroom dance.
