      I'm Vanessa! I'm an animator, storyboarder and production assistant etc. I
      enjoy blending techniques and aesthetics of traditional media into my
      digital practice.


      I graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2024 with a BFA in
      Film/Animation/Video. I developed my thesis project, "[Chasing
      Butterflies](/chasing-butterflies)" and worked as a production lead on my
      projects as well as a collaborative film, "[Curse
      Reverse](/curse-reverse)".


      Outside of animation, I also enjoy illustration, knitting & crocheting,
      and ballroom dance.
